**How it works:**
This visualizations accepts two dimensions and one measure or table calculation. It also accepts one dimensions, one pivot and one measure.
The column order should be as follows:

1. **Dimension** - This should be the date dimension for the x-axis.
2. **Dimension or Pivot** - The category that will break up the lines
4. **Measure/Table Calc** - The value that is displayed on the y-axis
