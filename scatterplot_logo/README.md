**How it works:**
This visualizations accepts two dimensions and two measures or table calculations. The column order should be as follows:

1. **Dimension** - This is the label of the image that is displayed. This value will be shown in the tooltip.
2. **Dimension** - The link to the hosted image
3. **Measure/Table Calc** - The value that is displayed on the x-axis
4. **Measure/Table Calc** - The value that is displayed on the y-axis
